# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# User.create(email: "admin@super.com", password: "123123", password_confirmation: "123123")
# Artist.create(name: "Ali", user_id: 1)
# Artist.create(name: "Ali1", user_id: 1)
# Artist.create(name: "Ali2", user_id: 1)
# Artist.create(name: "Ali3", user_id: 1)
# Artist.create(name: "Ali4", user_id: 1)
